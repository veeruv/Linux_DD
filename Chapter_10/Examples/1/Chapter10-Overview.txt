
Deferred Execution (Delay)

 1.  Busy Wait
     1.1     spinning on CPU.
             -  typically implemented as a "while (i++<  <time> )"  construct.
             -  or, using ndelay(), udelay() or mdelay().

*2.  sleep(), and 
*    wakeup()
     2.1     time-centric.
             some finite/known "elapsed" interval of time.
             - typically, jiffies or using HR timers.


     2.2     event-centric.
             e.g. device interrupt.  => block until an external event occurs.
*            - wait_queues. 

     2.3     using 
*            - kernel timers (again, jiffies-based)
*            - tasklets 
*            - workqueues

*3.   Interrupt Handling.
*    3.1     top-half (and, setting up the interrupt handler) 
*    3.2     bottom-half (use either of kernel-timers, tasklets or workqueues).

design considerations of kernel-timers, tasklets and workqueues.

trapping mouse interrupts, and identifying left/right mouse-button click, movement etc.
